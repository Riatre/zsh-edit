# zsh-edit
`zsh-edit` is a small, but handy set of editing tools for the Zsh command line.

## Better Word Matching
By default, Zsh's widgets
* <kbd>forward-word</kbd>,
* <kbd>backward-word</kbd>,
* <kbd>kill-word</kbd> and
* <kbd>backward-kill-word</kbd>

always move to the beginning of the next word and do not recognize subwords (for example, `dev` and
`Build` in `devBuild`). This often causes them to move or delete too much, especially in the
`forward` direction.

`zsh-edit` upgrades these widgets to add subword parsing and makes it so that movement in either
direction stops at the next word boundary, regardless whether that's the beginning or end of a
word. For example, with `WORDCHARS=''`, you now get the following behavior:

```zsh
       >  > >      >   >    >        >  >
shutdown.sh; gradlew devBuild; startup.sh
<        < < <       <  <      <       <
```

This has the following benefits:
* When your cursor is inside a word, you can now press <kbd>forward-word</kbd> or
  <kbd>backward-word</kbd> to reach either end of the word.
* When you have your cursor at either end of a word, pressing <kbd>kill-word</kbd> or
  <kbd>backward-kill-word</kbd> in the direction of the word will always kill the whole word and
  nothing else.
* You are now less likely to delete things you didn't want to delete.
* Subwords are now recognized and `devBuild` is parsed as two words, `dev` and `Build`, with the
  cursor stopping at the end of each.

### Customization
Subword matching can be customized by adding characters to `$WORDCHARS`. Any such character will be
parsed as starting a subword and the cursor will end up to the left of it. For example, with
`WORDCHARS=' .'`, the behavior above will change to be as follows:

```zsh
       >  >        >   >    >        >  >
shutdown.sh; gradlew devBuild; startup.sh
<       <   <       <   <     <       <
```

Personally, I use `WORDCHARS='%\*?-_.'`, which behaves like this:

```zsh
       >  >        >   >    >        >  >
shutdown.sh; gradlew devBuild; startup.sh
<       <  < <       <  <    < <      <
```

## Clipboard Viewer
Whenever you <kbd>yank</kbd>, `zsh-edit` will list the contents of your kill ring (including the
cut buffer) below your command line. Moreover, when you use <kbd>yank-pop</kbd>, `zsh-edit` will
show you which kill is currently selected, making it easier to cycle to the right one.

To view your clipboard at any time, without modifying your command line, just press
<kbd>yank-pop</kbd>.

In addition, whenever you perform a <kbd>yank</kbd>, `zsh-edit` eliminates all duplicate kills
from your kill ring. Thus, each entry listed is guaranteed to be unique.

## Reverse Yank-Pop
`zsh-edit` adds a new widget <kbd>reverse-yank-pop</kbd> and binds it to
<kbd>Alt</kbd><kbd>Shift</kbd><kbd>Y</kbd>. It functions just like <kbd>yank-pop</kbd>, but lets
you cycle in the opposite direction.

## Note About Key Bindings
Except for the addtion of [<kbd>reverse-yank-pop</kbd>](#reverse-yank-pop), `zsh-edit` does not
change your key bindings. To use the keyboard commands (a.k.a "widgets") that `zsh-edit` enhances,
you will need to know to which key strokes they are bound.
* Type `bindkey` to see your current key bindings.
* To add a new new keybinding or override an existing one, add lines like in this example to your
  `~/.zshrc` file:
  ```zsh
  # Ctrl-Y
  bindkey '^Y' yank

  # Alt-Y
  bindkey '^[y' yank-pop

  # Alt-Shift-Y
  bindkey '^[Y' reverse-yank-pop
  ```

  documentation](http://zsh.sourceforge.net/Doc/Release/Zsh-Line-Editor.html) for more info.
